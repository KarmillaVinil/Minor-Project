This was my #Minor-Project during the third year of my bachelors in technology in the stream of computer science with specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
This project was done by a team of three members including me, where i was the team lead.
This is a machine learning project done using a pre collected dataset and google collaboratory.
There are numerous unidentified objects in sky, but we cannot identify them without preconfirmed data. So the project Stellar classification aims to classify unidentified objects in the sky into Star, galaxy and quasar.
we developed a machine learning model svm classify these unidentified objects.
